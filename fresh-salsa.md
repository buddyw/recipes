# Buddy's Fresh Salsa

## Ingredients:

* 1 Red Bell pepper
* Juice from one med lime
* 5 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
* 1 white onion
* 3 Tbsp olive oil
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1/2 bunch fresh cilantro
* 2 Tbsp minced garlic
* 2-3 Serrano peppers (or your favorite fresh hot peppers)
* 6 Roma Tomatoes

## Instructions:
Wash and prep all vegetables by removing inedible parts and chopping them
into small enough pieces to fit in food processor.  Combine everything
except tomatoes and blend well - until there are no chunks.  Pour into
bowl, and then blend tomatoes to desired consistency. (I prefer chunky 
tomatoes.)  Mix blended tomatoes with the rest of the mixture and let it 
set in the refrigerator for at least 1-2 hours.
