# Buddy's Texas Style Chili

## Stock Ingredients:
* 1 lb marrow/soup bones
* 1 stalk celery
* 1 med onion quartered
* 1 + 1/2 cups dry red wine (optional)
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 Tbsp whole white pepper corns
* water to cover

## Chili Ingredients:
* 2 lb ground beef, deer, pork, or lamb (if you use deer, pair it with fattier meat)
* beef stock and marrow from above
* cumin
* ancho chili powder
* paprika
* cyan as needed to adjust heat
* 2 cans fire roasted tomatoes
* 2 T masa nixtamalera
* salt
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 onion finely chopped
* 1 cup coffee

## Stock Instructions:
* If using a pressure cooker, add stock ingredients to pressure cooker.  Cook @ 15 psi for 35 min and wait for it to cool enough to open.
* If using a slow cooker, add stock ingredients to the slow cooker and cook on low for 12-24hrs.  Longer is better.

Strain stock through wire mesh.  If you added a lot of water it is a good idea to reduce the stock at this point.  clean off the bones and extract the marrow.  Mash the marrow and save it for the chili.

Alternatively, you can use store bought beef stock, but you are sacrificing flavor.

## Chili Instructions:
Brown meat in a pot.  Add onion.  add garlic.  add rotels.  cook for a bit.  add stock, spices, coffee, cook together for 30 min or so.  Mix masa with warm water and add to chili.  Cook until the sauce is thick and flavors come together (at least 30 more min).  Season to taste.
