# Classic Cornbread

Preheat oven to 400 Degrees.  If you are using a cast iron pan, preheat that (oiled) as well.

## Mix Together:

* 1 cup of whole wheat flour
* 1 cup of corn meal
* 4 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 2 tbsp brown sugar

## Make a well and add:

* 2 beaten eggs
* 1 cup of milk
* 1/4 cup oil or fat (I prefer melted coconut oil or butter)

## If using buttermilk or yogurt:

* use 1 cup of buttermilk or plain yogurt instead of milk
* use only 2 tsp of baking powder instead of 4
* add 2 tsp of baking soda

## For Gluten Free options:
TBD - still playing with GF flour replacements

Stir until it's combined, but still lumpy.  Pour into hot oiled cast iron skillet or greased 9x9 baking pan.  Cook for about 25 min or until it browns.
